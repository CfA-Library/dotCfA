# dotCfA: Collaborating for Astronomy
## What is it?
Our goal is to help you be super-productive by creating a space to
spend one day focusing on one problem, with a room full of tech-minded
colleagues to bounce ideas off of. Great for:

  - Scratching the itch -- finally DOING that small project you've been
    pondering for months
  - Building something cool and fun (... that can then go on your CV)
  - Learning a boatload of new skills by teaming up on a project with
    someone who already knows what you wish you did.

## When and Where?
* All-day "office hours" for questions about Python and Git if you're
curious to learn about these increasingly popular tools. The CfA is home
to some true experts who can offer guidance and opinions.

* At 9 AM, coffee and bagels to kick things off. Learn more about what Hack Day's
about, hear about the projects that folks will be working on, and chat
with your tech-minded CfA colleagues.

* At 1:30 PM, a round of lightening talks to show off cool tricks, new ideas, and useful tools.

* At 4 PM, a round of demos showing off what our industrious hackers
have accomplished over the day! To be followed by refreshments and
mingling as we celebrate a productive day.
